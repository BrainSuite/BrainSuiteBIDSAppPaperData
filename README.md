## BrainSuite BIDS App Paper Data ##
Our recently submitted abstract and manuscript demonstrate the use of the BrainSuite BIDS App by performing a study on the Amsterdam Open MRI Collection's (AOMIC) Population Imaging of Psychology  datasets available from [OpenNeuro](openneuro.org). 

This repository contains the additional files necessary to perform the full set of analyses in the abstract and paper.

The imaging and demographic data are freely available under a CC0 license
[Amsterdam Open MRI Collection's Population Imaging of Psychology 2 (AOMIC-PIOP2)](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002790/versions/2.0.0) dataset available from [OpenNeuro](openneuro.org) and other files required to perform a demonstration of BrainSuite BIDS App's participant-level processing and the BrainSuite Dashboard quality control functionality. These files in this repository include:

* AOMIC-PIOP2 : a BIDS-compliant study directory containing data from 4 participants; modalities include T1-weighted (T1-w), diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).
* aomic-piop2_preprocspec.json : a JSON file containing parameters for T1-weighted, dMRI, and rs-fMRI processing.
* README.md : instructions for running participant-level workflows.

The two data collections used are:
[Amsterdam Open MRI Collection's Population Imaging of Psychology 1 (AOMIC-PIOP1)](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002785/versions/2.0.0) 

[Amsterdam Open MRI Collection's Population Imaging of Psychology 2 (AOMIC-PIOP2)](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002790/versions/2.0.0)
